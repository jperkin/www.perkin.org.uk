I am a minimalist at heart, and I love command line interfaces and text files.

However, I'm also pragmatic, and so for a long time my blog has been powered by
Wordpress, which made it relatively easy to manage content and design.  I just
didn't want the hassle of maintaining something myself.

Somewhere along the way recently I stumbled across
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), and the idea of generating a
static site from templates.

I'd seen a few sites I liked the look of, and I loved the idea of simplifying
my site (and editing posts in vim!), and so the end result is the site you see
now.  The theme is based on [skim.la](http://skim.la/)'s site.

I pondered implementing something like [disqus](http://disqus.com/) for
comments, but honestly I get so few proper responses, compared to the hundreds
and hundreds of spam attempts, that it's not worth it - if you want to comment
on a post, just use twitter (I'll probably implement a little button to do that
at some point).

Also, I got rid of categories, simpler to just have tags.

It's likely I've messed up conversion of my old blog posts, as I did them all
manually.  If you spot anything obviously broken, please let me know.  One of
the great things of the Jekyll approach is that you can simply manage your site
via github, and so if you prefer you can comment on breakages
