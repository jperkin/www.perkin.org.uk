title: pkgsrc binary packages for Mac OSX
---

[pkgsrc](http://www.pkgsrc.org/) is a cross-platform packaging framework,
designed to build a large number of third-party open source software packages
on many different operating systems.

[Joyent](http://www.joyent.com/) provide a regular bulk build of all packages
on OSX, which you can easily download and install onto your systems.  Included
is the `pkgin` package manager which is designed to look and function very
similar to `apt-get`.

Currently there are nearly 9,000 up-to-date binary packages available.  The
packages are built on OSX Leopard (10.5) so that they are generic enough to run
on all modern versions of OSX.

The current release is `pkgsrc-2013Q2`.

## Quick Start

If you have already installed a pkgsrc bootstrap, you should be able to upgrade
to the latest release simply by updating the `pkgin` URL and upgrading all
packages:

{% highlight console %}
$ sudo ed /usr/pkg/etc/pkgin/repositories.conf <<EOF
%s/2013Q1/2013Q2/g
wq
EOF
$ sudo pkgin update
$ sudo pkgin full-upgrade
{% endhighlight %}

Otherwise install a new bootstrap:

{% highlight console %}
: Download and install the bootstrap containing pkgin and the packaging tools
$ curl http://pkgsrc.smartos.org/packages/Darwin/bootstrap/bootstrap-2013Q2.tar.gz | sudo gnutar -zxpf - -C /

: Packages are kept under /usr/pkg, add to $PATH
$ PATH=/usr/pkg/sbin:/usr/pkg/bin:$PATH

: Refresh the package repository to get the very latest packages
$ sudo pkgin -y update

: Find out what packages (and how many) are available
$ pkgin avail | wc -l

: Search for a particular package, for example 'tmux'
$ pkgin search tmux

: Install a package
$ sudo pkgin -y install tmux

: Upgrade all packages
$ sudo pkgin -y full-upgrade
{% endhighlight %}

As it is such a common FAQ, note that the `git` package is currently spelled
`scmgit`.

## Building From Source

pkgsrc is based on the FreeBSD [ports](http://www.freebsd.org/ports/) system,
so if you are used to that (or other similar forks such as OpenBSD ports) and
want to build from source the procedure is very similar:

{% highlight console %}
: Install the git package and fetch pkgsrc from the converted cvs->git repo
$ sudo pkgin -y install scmgit
$ git clone git://github.com/jsonn/pkgsrc.git

: By default you will get pkgsrc trunk.  If you want the most recent stable
: branch, then switch to it first.
$ git checkout pkgsrc_2013Q2

: Change to the package directory and download/compile/install with one command.
$ cd pkgsrc/<category>/<package>
$ bmake install
{% endhighlight %}

Here are some common configuration settings you may wish to add to
`/usr/pkg/etc/mk.conf`:

{% highlight make %}
# Avoid root password prompt for package install/deinstall
SU_CMD=		sudo /bin/sh -c

# Re-use existing binary packages
BINPKG_SITES=	http://pkgsrc.smartos.org/packages/Darwin/2013Q2/
DEPENDS_TARGET=	bin-install

# Build everything with -j8
MAKE_JOBS=	8

#Â Ignore vulnerability and license checks
ALLOW_VULNERABLE_PACKAGES=	yes
SKIP_LICENSE_CHECK=		yes

# Configure where to store distfiles, binary packages, and build areas
DISTDIR=	/work/distfiles
PACKAGES=	/work/packages
WRKOBJDIR=	/var/tmp/pkgsrc-build
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to change the build options for a particular package, first find
out which options are available with `show-options`, and then set the
particular option in `/usr/pkg/etc/mk.conf` before building:

{% highlight console %}
$ cd pkgsrc/net/nmap

$ bmake show-options
Any of the following general options may be selected:
	inet6	 Enable support for IPv6.
	ndiff	 Enable tool to compare Nmap scans.
	zenmap	 Enable nmap GUI frontend.

These options are enabled by default:
	inet6

These options are currently enabled:
	inet6

You can select which build options to use by setting PKG_DEFAULT_OPTIONS
or PKG_OPTIONS.nmap.

$ vi /usr/pkg/etc/mk.conf
PKG_OPTIONS.nmap+=	ndiff

$ bmake install
{% endhighlight %}

## Further Information

The [pkgsrc guide](http://www.netbsd.org/docs/pkgsrc/) is packed with
information about the internals of pkgsrc, and is useful if you would like to
dig deeper and start hacking.

There are also various [pkgsrc-related posts](/tags/pkgsrc.html) on my blog
which contain various hints and tricks, though you may want to skip the
[SmartOS](http://smartos.org/)-specific sections.  I also post new branch
builds and updates there.

We hang out on Freenode `#pkgsrc`, and our mailing lists are:

* [pkgsrc-users@netbsd.org](mailto:pkgsrc-users@netbsd.org) for users
* [tech-pkg@netbsd.org](mailto:tech-pkg@netbsd.org) for developers

## Get Involved

There are over 12,000 packages in pkgsrc, so there are quite a few which
currently do not build on OSX.  The most recent bulk build report is available
[here](http://pkgsrc.smartos.org/reports/2013Q2-Darwin/20130715.1420/meta/report.html)
and shows which packages are failing along with their build logs.

Build fixes, package updates as well as new packages are very welcome:

* If you have a small patch and prefer using GitHub, feel free to raise it as
  an [issue](https://github.com/joyent/pkgsrc/issues) against Joyent's
  [pkgsrc](https://github.com/joyent/pkgsrc) repository.

* If you want to get involved in creating new packages, the
  [pkgsrc-wip](http://pkgsrc-wip.sourceforge.net/) project is a great way to
  get started.

* Otherwise, there is always the [NetBSD GNATS
  database](http://www.netbsd.org/support/send-pr.html).

## Finally

Enjoy!
