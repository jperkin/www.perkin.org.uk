title: About Me
---

Thirty-something.  Married.  Three kids.  Living just outside London in the UK.

## Work

I've been interested in computers from an early age, and am very privileged to
get paid to mess around on them for a living.

I work for [Joyent](/posts/goodbye-oracle-hello-joyent.html) where I am
involved in [pkgsrc](http://www.pkgsrc.org/), the packaging system used for
[SmartOS](http://smartos.org/), our advanced open-source operating system
designed for multi-tenancy environments (i.e. "Cloud Computing").

Previously I have worked as a sysadmin/developer/engineer at MySQL AB/Sun
Microsystems/Oracle, the BBC, and Netcraft.

My professional profile is available on
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jperkin), however if you are a recruiter,
I should warn you that I am almost certainly not interested ;-)

## Rest

As an engineer I of course love to work on technical stuff outside of the
dayjob too, and you can find various open source bits and pieces I have written
on [GitHub](https://github.com/jperkin).

You can also find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jperkin) and
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/jperkin) doing the "social media" thing.

## Play

I enjoy playing the piano, and you can see some really bad examples of me doing
so on my [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/jonathanperkin) profile.
