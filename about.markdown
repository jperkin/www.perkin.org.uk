title: About Me

Thirty-something geek.  Married.  Three kids.  Living just outside London in
the UK.

## Work

I've been interested in computers from an early age, and am very privileged to
these days get paid to mess around on them for a living.

* I started my career in 2000, as a Unix Systems administrator at
  [Netcraft](http://www.netcraft.com/).

* After that, between 2001 and 2007 I worked for the
  [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/), where I was an Internet Engineer / Unix Systems
  Administrator looking after the bbc.co.uk infrastructure, including their
  very popular websites as well providing Internet access for 25,000 BBC staff.

* I then joined [MySQL AB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL_AB) in 2007 as a
  Senior Release Engineer, producing MySQL releases and doing some more systems
  administration.  During that time we were acquired twice, first by
  [Sun Microsystems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) and then by
  [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/).  In 2011 I became the Release Engineering
  Manager, and in 2012 I moved over to the Linux Group as a Release Engineer
  for Oracle Linux and Oracle VM.

I am currently working for
[Joyent](http://{{ site.url }}/posts/goodbye-oracle-hello-joyent.html), hacking
on [pkgsrc](http://www.pkgsrc.org/) for [SmartOS](http://smartos.org/), our
advanced operating system designed for multi-tenancy environments (i.e. "Cloud
Computing").  This allows me to combine my passions for pkgsrc, operating
system development, and large-scale infrastructure, and I love working with an
extremely talented set of developers.

My professional profile is available on
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jperkin).

## Rest

I love spending time with my family.  I have an awesome wife who keeps me sane
and full of yummy food, and three fantastic kids who can be hard work a lot of
the time, but they are great fun, very talented, and can be a great source of
joy!

Being a geek I work on technical stuff outside of work, and enjoy writing open
source bits and pieces which can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/jperkin) and
[Launchpad](http://launchpad.net/~jperkin).

You can also find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jperkin) and
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/jperkin) doing the "social media" thing.

## Play

I enjoy playing the piano, and you can see some really bad examples of me doing
so on my [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/jonathanperkin) profile.
