title: About Me
---

Thirty-something geek.  Married.  Three kids.  Live near London, in the UK.

## Work

I've been interested in computers from an early age, and am very privileged to
these days get paid to mess around on them for a living.

My career started at [Netcraft](http://www.netcraft.com/) as a Unix sysadmin,
then onto the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/) where I did a lot more sysadmin
making bbc.co.uk work.

However, having been interested in open source since the mid 90s and being
involved with projects such as [NetBSD](http://www.netbsd.org/) along the way,
I was keen to do more of the development side of things, and was very grateful
to join [MySQL AB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL_AB) as a release
engineer, which eventually took me through
[Sun Microsystems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) and finally
into [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/) where I currently work as a release
engineer for Oracle Linux and other Linux products.

My professional profile is available on
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jperkin).

## Rest

I love spending time with the family.  I have an awesome wife who keeps me sane
and full of yummy food, and three fantastic kids who can be hard work a lot of
the time, but they are great fun, very talented, and help to keep me humble.

Being a geek I work on technical stuff outside of work, and enjoy writing open
source bits and pieces which can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/jperkin) and
[Launchpad](http://launchpad.net/~jperkin).

You can also find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jperkin) and
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/jperkin) doing the "social media" thing.

## Play

I enjoy playing the piano, and you can see some really bad examples of me doing
so on my [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/jonathanperkin) profile.
