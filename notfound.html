          <p>Sorry, can't find that page.  I migrated my site away from
             Wordpress, and so things like categories no longer work.</p>
          <p>You can probably find what you are looking for in my list of blog
             posts below though, and hopefully search engines will soon catch up
             with my new layout.</p>
          <p>Thanks for watching!</p>
